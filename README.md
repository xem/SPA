# HAMMAM

HAMMAM is a tiny SPA (Single Page Application) framework,<br>
Lightweight, standalone, full-featured, and compatible with all modern browsers and devices (plus IE9).

## Features


### Component-based

- The SPA is built with "components" having their own HTML, CSS and JS.
- Components can be easily configured and have their own functions.
- They can inherit from the declaration of another component, and overload it. 
- They can contain other components, or componentsLists (groups of N components using a similar structure)
- They can add, remove or replace themselves or their children.
- ComponentsLists can also be reordered.

### State and data

- Components have a "state" property defining their behavior.
- They also have a "dataset" property defining their content.

### Templating

- Components are displayed using templates.
- Templates are regular HTML files, except they can use "mustaches" to perform tests, loops, access the component's data, execute JS code, etc.

### URL & routing

- The built-in URL engine allows to get and set URL's content, parameters and hash easily.
- The built-in router allows to display a given "page" depending on the current URL.
- Using the History API (polyfilled for IE9), HAMMAM avoid page reloads and keeps a clean browser history.
