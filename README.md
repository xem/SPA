# HAMMAM

A tiny SPA (Single Page Application) framework for the Web,<br>
Ultralight, for all modern browsers and devices, and with a native feel,<br>
Full HTML5/CSS/JS, and requiring no server configuration.

## Features


### Component

- The page is built with "components" having their own HTML, CSS, JS, including data and event listeners.
- Simple configuration, composition and inheritence between components.
- Components can inherit from the declaration of other components, and overload them freely. 
- Components can contain one or many other components, or componentsLists (groups of N components using a similar structure)
- Components can add, remove or replace themselves or their children.
- ComponentsLists can also be reordered.
- Simple API for accessing any component of the page as well as its data and functions from anywhere.

### State, data and models

- Components have a "state" defining their behavior and a "dataset" defining their content.
- Models help components fill their dataset using static data, localStorage, JSON files, AJAX calls, etc.

### Templating

- Views are regular HTML with "mustache" features meant to ease the use of datasets, if's, loops, etc.
- They can be executed at runtime or built with Node for more speed.
